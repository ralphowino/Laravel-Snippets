Laravel-Snippets
================

A simple collection of Laravel libraries and files I use while working with Laravel. They help me speed up my development process maybe they'll be of assistance to you as well.


Structure

The files are structured in modules which have subfolders that follow the laravel convention.


Repositories

I use repositories and Inversion of Control in all my coding to increase abstration while making my code more testable.  I also strive to make my code as DRY as possible. 


Feedback
I would love to get your feedback on ways to improve the coding. I'm always interested in learning new things/ways of doings.

Modules Included
This list will grow as I standardise more and more of my work. If you have any module you'd like to see added. Please make a request and I'll add it in due time.
